    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
      <li>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</li>
      <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</li>
    </ul>
      <h2>Word of advice</h2>
      <p>Do not skip a turn, it's a game purely of luck</p>
      <p>Have fun <img src="img/smiley.gif" id="luck"></p>
